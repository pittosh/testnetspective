The rapidity of the economic, political and social changes are driving new ways of governance in U.S. Civilian and Health government agencies especially with constraints being placed on the budget.Some of the most complex challenges today and in the near future are due to financial regulatory oversight reforms, healthcare system reforms, integration of technology and information sharing among law enforcement organizations, enhancing new transportation infrastructure and overhauling the education systems. Other areas in the government space needing attention include strengthening cyber security for latest threats, improving energy efficiency and green initiatives and improving budgeting and tax management.

Some of the goals of the government agencies are to –

* Enable and ensure effective delivery of services to citizens while providing regional and individualistic personalization.
* Increase the efficiency of business processes, provide quality service and optimal use of public resources
* Evolve regulatory frameworks and manage them as they change
* Provide easy to understand, secure and transparent services for all citizens
* Manage and report revenue collection and expenditure efficiently
* Build and manage infrastructure for real-time information sharing across agencies
* Define metrics and measure for success of all outcomes across all activities

These goals can be achieved by U.S. government agencies only by improving and developing their IT solutions. With budget constraints today and in the near future, governments have to focus on being cost effective,enhancing productivity and reducing the cost of IT operations. Governments are thus undertaking infrastructure consolidation and virtualization, leveraging shared service models and moving towards open source and other cost-cutting alternatives.
