A good architecture design should fit in with your legacy systems and products, and should build on what has proven to work. The architecture should also enhance the value of your past investments in technology and processes and exploit opportunities for reuse within the system and across systems. This is especially true in the Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology Industries, wherein regulatory evironment and diverse needs require a well planned scalable solution to be put in place. Additionally, a good solution architecture provides for present and future integration across various I.T. products like EHR’s, ERP’s, Custom Software with each other and across Medical Devices, Mobile Phones, Software based products and other technology infrastructure.

**Product Architecture Design**

Designing the architecture of a product for a hardware system, a software system or a combination of both requires a varied skill set. In the case of systems that spans across both hardware and software like the embedded systems, the design and development involves many challenges. Embedded systems have small memory footprints, small screen sizes, tiny or real time operating systems and are usually designed to perform a dedicated function. A team with a diverse knowledge related to hardware, software and other related domain is required which adds to the complexity of getting the design right. Our teams at Netspective with a host of varied skills in hardware, software and embedded systems have been working together in getting out well designed and developed products.
