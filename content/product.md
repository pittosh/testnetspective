Medical devices and applications firms today have an opportunity to radically transform their business in the next five years. The growth is expected to be exponential in the U.S., European and emerging markets.This provides an opportunity for Medical Technology firms to re-look at their product portfolio and develop a product and platform strategy that provides for long term and sustained growth on a global scale.

Measuring the past portfolio’s success and use of decision support tools to create forecasts for the future would be the first step. This would need to be followed by mapping and analyzing the current portfolio with the business objectives for revenue, profitability, market share, customer acceptance and ability to execute. This is an ongoing process as the market and investor demands are dynamic. This analysis provides medical devices and applications firms with realistic information as to whether it would be wise to continue down the current path or to invest in new technology, platform or portfolio. It also helps them to decide when to shelve the product or make a end of life product decisions.
