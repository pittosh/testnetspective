The past few years have seen drastic changes in testing methodologies. Organizations are moving towards test automation in order to save on cost and time. Enterprises are analyzing every phase of the testing life cycle to find out the areas that can be automated by using tools. From initial automated testing strategies where scripting knowledge was required to write scripts to automate testing, the testing industry has gone to making script less testing frameworks. These advancements in automation without the knowledge of scripting languages have allowed users with good business knowledge to create the automation scripts based on the business usecases.

A good Test Automation Framework and plan provides the ability to improve your product quality, enhance the ability to deliver releases quickly, and provides for easy ability to manage your use cases in a regulated environment. All these have a tremendous impact on cost, quality and revenue impact to the business.
