Business operations in Healthcare and Medical Technology firms are faced with a dire need for financial, operational and clinical performance improvement and optimization. The most successful way to analyze business performance and plan for improvement is by considering 3 essential components: people, process, and technology. Combining and optimizing these 3 components improves financial, operational and clinical performance. Many of the existing processes are not suitable for todayâ€™s fast paced and technology centric environments. New businesses, regulatory and partnership models tend to cause a lack of alignment between the process and technology components. Understanding and optimizing these can allow enterprises to enable its employees with new tools to achieve the following 3 major performance goals for every organization.

* People Successful change is dependent on people, and specifically on the support of those people most affected by the potential changes. In the case of financial and clinical performance improvement many professional disciplines are involved, each with a history of training and experience which is the basis of how work is performed.
* Process Process design/re-design can be the most neglected component in the day to day operations or for a technology deployment strategy. A complete understanding of how work is currently accomplished and a clear vision on how work should be accomplished in the future is essential. Without this understanding and a definition of the system capabilities supporting the future, the performance improvement effort is placed in jeopardy.
* Technology For healthcare or medical technology organizations, the decisions surrounding the choice of technology and its deployment are a critical foundation for success. Designing of the application or solution so that it meshes well with the people and processes is a key element for successful product adoption.
