Before they put software into production, many enterprises conduct an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) process to make sure it’s bulletproof.

To conduct IV&V testing, IT and Product organizations in regulated industries like Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology hire third parties with no ties to the professionals who developed the software. These third parties provide a clear, unbiased analysis of software solutions being built. Testers not only verify that software is built correctly, they make sure you’re building the right product.

When performed thoroughly, the IV&V process :

* Identifies defects before you roll out your system, reduces system life cycle risks, drives development along safe lines, and minimizes cost overruns
* Assures that the product meets your standards and policies conforms to your system requirements
* It supports the decision-making process by acting as a source for technical alternatives
* Determines whether product criteria meet your goals
* Ensures the end product meets stakeholder expectations
* Enhances employees of confidence in system performance
* Increases customer satisfaction / retention
