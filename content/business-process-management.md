Having optimized business processes in a regulated industry provides organizations the ability to keep operating costs low while efficiently delivering services or selling products. Aligning an organization’s business processes to your customer’s requirements in a holistic manner is the key tenet to Business Process Management(BPM).

We believe that in order to achieve optimum business efficiency and employee effectiveness, a good understanding, implementation and control of the business processes is essential followed by automation of these processes. The processes should be repeatable but flexible enough to make changes based on customer needs and market demands.

### Business Process Management in Healthcare
**Meaningful Use: Are you ready?**

The new Meaningful Use standards issued by HHS offer well-prepared providers an unprecedented opportunity to collect large financial bonuses. However, meeting these standards won’t be easy.![Healthcare-IT-Training](/Healthcare-IT-Training.jpg#left)

To comply with Meaningful Use rules, providers will need to make extensive use of certified electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) not only to capture and share data, but also to employ advanced electronic clinical processes that result in improved outcomes.

Providers have five years to complete their Meaningful Use rollout, but the first requirements will kick in next year. To meet this deadline and the others that follow providers will need to implement new health IT initiatives quickly and effectively. That where Netspective can help you out.

Netspective’s team of experts help you create an optimized IT infrastructure and business processes that will enable you to take full advantage of the Meaningful Use opportunity. Along the way, we’ll help you develop a long-term enterprise strategy that will ensure enhanced efficiency, better healthcare, greater safety and improved patient experiences.

We’ll help you define best practices and optimized business processes, put a Meaningful Use-compliant IT environment and governance structure in place which will support your existing goals and assist you in meeting these standards in the future.

Using tools like Embarcadero’s ER/Studio Portal, Netspective will help you identify areas of Meaningful Use to target and define criteria for success. We identify and catalog all data sources and sinks, all existing applications and services and all external interfaces that you’ll need to use to ensure Meaningful Use compliance.
