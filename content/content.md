Organizations today need easy access to relevant and accurate information to perform at peak levels. Providing that information at the time and in the format that it is required is Netspective’s primary concern. Most organizations have a wealth of information both structured and unstructured that has accumulated over time. This information can be a strategic asset if properly collated, categorized and analyzed. The insights gained from such an exercise can provide valuable inputs in the tactical decision making process. Netspective provides organizations with that strategic advantage.

Netspective’s Enterprise Content and Document Management solutions use a combination of technology and strategies to capture documents and content, and to manage, store and deliver them in a way that keeps business processes moving forward. Depending on the nature of the solution required and on client preferences and budgetary constraints, Netspective uses proprietary or open source tools to build these solutions to capture and manage enterprise content in a unified electronic file, and make it accessible to users both on and offline.

Netspective was an early adapter of SharePoint, Microsoft’s web-based tool, which has an integrated suite of functionalities that can help organizations improve efficiency by providing comprehensive content management, enterprise search and business intelligence capabilities by accelerating shared business processes, and by facilitating information sharing and collaboration across the organization. Netspective also uses open source tools such as Drupal, WordPress and Joomla to develop content and document management solutions. As the outcome of the voluntary effort of thousands of developers across the globe, these open source tools come free, are reliable, secure and easy to use, offer a range of built-in themes and templates, and have a number of plug-ins making them modular and extendible.

Whatever be the technology used, Netspective’s objective is to provide organizations with an advanced content and document management platform for creating, optimizing, and analyzing content across all internally and externally facing Web-based business applications portals, intranets, websites, extranets, and self-service applications.

Netspective uses these technologies and tools also to create a shared space for real-time collaboration and information sharing, providing capabilities like messaging, calendaring and scheduling apart from document management. These solutions help users see what colleagues, vendors, partners and clients are doing, and everyone with appropriate credentials are able to access, evaluate, share and add comments. Netspective’s content, document management and collaboration solutions help organizations to:

* Capture, archive and leverage existing knowledge along with context
* Mirror paper-based documents using more efficient electronic processes
* Share information securely across workspaces
* Find relevant information instantly
* Work collaboratively even with geographically dispersed teams
* Get better productivity from your mobile workforce
* Improve regulatory compliance\

Netspective’s content and document management and collaboration solutions have the potential to bring visible and immediate benefits including:

* Improved decision making
* Business process improvement
* Greater operational efficiency
* Improved communication within the organization
* Cost reduction through material savings (paper, toner and copying machines)
* Reduced dependence on off-site storage
