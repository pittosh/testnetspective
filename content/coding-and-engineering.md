Most Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology firms are able to develop the strategy, planning and architecture of their IT solution or product / platform internally or with outside consulting help in a short time. The next biggest challenge is enabling a large team of skilled resources that bring ability to innovate and refine the ideas, then convert these ideas into physical devices, embedded software or application software with appropriate User Interface and Industrial Design that can beat the business and technology objectives. Enterprises in industries other than Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology have been leveraging various outsourcing models to enable a large team for short duration. The key is to choose a partner that builds a skilled team, can bring in domain and technology ideas to help you build the best in class product or application and can help re-tool your existing team.

### Software Development Services Portfolio

Finding a shrink-wrapped solution that meets your workflow requirements can be very difficult. Each organization is unique, and has its own specific goals and objectives, its own processes and procedures. When you know what you need, but off-the-shelf products won’t get the job done, custom development on embedded, desktop, server side or mobile software application development expertise is the answer.

### Support for your entire development life cycle

Netspective offers a very broad range of custom application development services, including the addition of new features and functions to existing applications, application re-engineering, migration of legacy systems to modern technology platforms and web-enabling of legacy applications.

Netspective senior software development team offers not just knowledge and experience, but also mature processes and methodologies, a firm command of industry best practices, a portfolio of re-usable components and efficient coding practices that lead to significantly lower costs.

### System Analysis and Design

Once the market study is completed and a decision has been arrived at regarding what product to develop, the next step is to decide how to go about developing it. Netspective will help you develop a cost-effective solution that can potentially perform customers jobs better than solutions offered by the competition. Since problems popping up during the design phase can result in very expensive remedial work later in the development process, Netspective pays careful attention to ensure the design is logical. A prototype will be developed as proof of concept. Our team also pays close attention to the scalability of the application to accommodate future requirements.

###  Code Generation

Once the conceptual system is designed, developed and tested in a hypothetical environment, Netspective developers will move in. The development team will translate the design into a machine-readable form through code generation.

### Development Methodologies

Based on the product under development and various other parameters, Netspective will adopt a suitable System Development Life Cycle methodology from those given below:

* Waterfall Model 
* Structured Evolutionary Prototyping Model 
* Incremental Model
* Spiral Development Model 
* Agile Development Model 
	* Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
	* Feature Driven Development (FDD)
	* Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)
	* Rapid Application Development (RAD)
	* Scrum
	* Extreme Programming (XP)
	* Rational Unified Process (RUP)
	* Tailored Development Model

When we develop an application, we focus on implementing the high-priority features quickly then adding on the bells and whistles.To do this, we use an agile development model that allows requirements and design to be continuously refined as code development progresses, building applications in small increments and validating them as we proceed.

### Multi-platform, multi-industry expertise

Netspective builds, deploys and maintains scalable applications for a wide spectrum of clients in the Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology.

We use both proprietary and Open Source technologies to develop highly customized and intuitive solutions. When we build applications, you can be sure that you’re getting cutting-edge technology based on the most flexible, powerful platforms available today. We bring significant experience working on proprietary as well as open source platforms across multiple end point hardware like Desktops, Servers, Cloud, Mobility, Custom hardware, etc. Our team also has exposure to a variety of other technologies deployed across other industries outside of Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology, which substantially reduces the technology learning curve, while allowing us to quickly build tailor-made regulated products and IT solutions.

Open Source software is a critical tool for today’s business. Not only is it free, it’s often more powerful than commercially available products. What’s more, you benefit from the skillsof a large community of programmers who continually develop, improve and evolve its core.

In the proprietary model, companies write code, hide it behind binaries, charge customers vast sums for use of the software, and then charge them again for updates and fixes.But Open Source development frees you from vendor lock-in.
