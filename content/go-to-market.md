All Product or Services firms need to define channels they will use to connect with their clients and generate revenue and profitability. This includes organizational processes such as development, branding strategies and market research and analysis. These processes are essential in guiding sales strategies and carrying customer interactions from initial contact through to fulfillment.

A firm’s Go-To-Market strategy should help them develop and deliver a unique value proposition to their target market. A good value proposition is based on informed decisions on developing market focus, investments in product or service development and investments in sales. These well calculated decisions are based on the firms perspective on how the market will positively respond.Fine-tuning the target markets into granular categories and building value propositions that are unique or differentiated for that category are some of the key strategies to be followed by organizations.

There’s never been a better and more important time to innovate.

  * Tighter budgets, new technologies and the competitive necessity to re-think, reinvent and rewire are creating unprecedented conditions for a new wave of game-changing innovation.
  * Much of the innovative technology today has been born out of low-cost low-risk environments including software-as-a-service and mobile functionality.
