Leading Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology firms have automated complex industry specific business processes by building IT applications. The solutions may have been developed using the best approaches and technologies that had existed at the time of its implementation and successfully deployed within the organizations. With time, more complexities may have been added to these systems by repeated integration of new functionality and adding plugins to support new technology. The additions and integrations over time resulted in a monolithic system talking to hundreds and hundreds of applications. These systems caused a sharp increase in support costs, decrease in quality due to constant bugs and user frustration.

Product companies also make decisions to add and update software applications based on the market demands, pressures on marketing times and cost constraints. These decisions over a long period of time become more complex as multiple versions of the software need to be managed across multiple platforms supporting innumerable integrations. The maintenance of these kinds of systems becomes a phenomenal effort with rising costs, profitability requirements and customer satisfaction.
