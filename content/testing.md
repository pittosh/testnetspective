Today’s market competition forces products or solutions to rapidly evolve to meet the growing demands of the industry. This makes enterprises in the regulated industries like Healthcare, Government and Medical Technology to put out new technologies and feature enhancements to the users in a shorter span of time. Consequentially, organizations would like to cut down on the time for testing in order to allow more time to market the product.

Even though organizations want to reduce the time spent on testing, the quality of the end product that needs to be put out to the user should not suffer. It should meet all business objectives, functional requirements, industry regulations and the safety and privacy criteria. If an end product is buggy, there will be very little adoption by the user even though the best solution is out there. Hence all solutions need to undergo a quality assurance process from the beginning of the product lifecycle and a meticulous testing before delivery and deployment. It is also vital that the products be tested from functionality, performance and system integration point of view, so as to satisfy the varied needs of their customers.

In the mobile space, there has been an explosion of mobile devices in the recent years operating on all sorts of platforms, screen sizes and processing capabilities. Before deploying applications on these disparate systems, every targeted platform needs to be intensively tested. This calls for automated testing so as to achieve a complete and thorough testing of each device in shorter spans of time.
