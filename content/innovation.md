It takes more than sustaining and improving current value models to operate in today’s Healthcare and Medical Technology business. To build a platform for success in tomorrow’s business environment, new and innovative value models need to be in place as part of the organization’s innovation strategy.

The HITECH Act offers what may be the most significant opportunity that healthcare providers have ever had, to improve patient care and generate revenue substantially not only as a direct outcome of enhanced operational efficiency but also by way of increased Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Under HITECH, the federal government is handing out billions in incentives to providers who successfully implement electronic medical records.![health-care](/health-care.jpg#left)

To get their share of HITECH funding, it’s critical for healthcare organizations to demonstrate that they are making meaningful use of their EMRs and integrating Medical / Clinical devices and applications with their EMRs.

Medical Devices and Applications firms have a similar advantage to gain from the HITECH funding, by providing value driven technology that helps providers achieve their efficiency and meaningful use goals.

Unfortunately, healthcare providers don’t have forever to capitalize on the HITECH opportunity. If providers don’t hit IT adoption goals soon, they could not only lose the chance to get incentives, but also face large fines. The time to act is now.

This is where both Healthcare providers and Medical solutions firms need to think of innovation. A good technology innovation strategy that is tied to incentives today can yield very good returns and is essential to the success of the organizations long term goals.
